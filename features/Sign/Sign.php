	/**
	 *	Nino							A compact filesystembased php framework
	 *	Sign							A member signs a document of the Pdf feature on a page of the website. The
	 *										owner asks (request(), or the panel): the document is rendered through Pdf with
	 *										the owner's own signature on its fields, kept as shown.pdf with its sha256, and
	 *										the member is mailed a link, GET /.sign?t=<token>. The link opens a page that
	 *										shows the document, the sentence the member agrees to with a box to tick, a pad
	 *										to draw the signature on - or a field to type a name - and two buttons; it changes
	 *										nothing but the mark that it was viewed, so that a mail scanner uses nobody's
	 *										link up. POST /.sign signs or declines. Signing renders the document again with
	 *										the signature on every field of the member and, as a page of its own at the end,
	 *										the record of the signing - who, when, from where, which document (its sha256),
	 *										how, and the sentence agreed to (Pdf's option append) -, and keeps it as
	 *										signed.pdf with its sha256; both files are kept and never rewritten. What this
	 *										is: a simple electronic signature (eIDAS, Art. 25) with the record of its
	 *										circumstances, no more.
	 *
	 *										The document is rendered in the site's native language, so that the bytes can be
	 *										made again: before it is signed, the unsigned document is rendered once more with
	 *										the day of the request and has to be the one that was shown, byte for byte (the
	 *										sha256 of shown.pdf). The file carries no version of the Pdf feature, so an update
	 *										of it that leaves the layout of a document as it was does not end a pending request;
	 *										a change to the template, to a block, to the layout (header, footer, logo, the
	 *										owner's picture) or to a site text the document reads does. Then the request is
	 *										over, in the state 'changed' that is written with its time: nothing is signed, the
	 *										page says so and shows no form - not Decline either, the document is not the one
	 *										shown -, the owner is mailed, and the panel's "Ask again" makes a new request of the
	 *										same template, data, member and page, the old one staying as it is. The two renders
	 *										of a signing run inside the lock of the index, which holds every other write of it
	 *										for the time they take.
	 *
	 *										GET /.sign/pdf?t=|r=&kind=shown|signed answers the PDF as the file response of the
	 *										kernel (\Nino\Http, "Answering a File") to the holder of the token, to the member
	 *										it was asked of and to a workbench session that holds the permission of the panel;
	 *										everybody else is the same 404.
	 *
	 *										The data is Sign\Store's: /data/sign/requests.php and a directory for each request.
	 *										Two components put the page's form and a member's list on any page the Builder
	 *										composes (componentSignForm() and componentSignList(); the manifest declares
	 *										them), and the panel in Admin/Admin.php asks, reminds, cancels and reads. Other
	 *										features build on it through request(), requests(), get(), path(), remind(),
	 *										cancel() and remove(), and the callbacks '/sign/signed' and '/sign/declined', each
	 *										fired with the request.
