	/**
	 *	Nino							A compact filesystembased php framework
	 *	Review						A player for the audio and video files that the Files feature holds for the groups of
	 *										the Members feature, with comments at a time in the track. A member opens a page that
	 *										carries [review-player]: without a file chosen it lists the audio and video files the
	 *										member may see (what Files::allowed() lets them), each a link to the same page with
	 *										?review=<id>; with one chosen it plays it - the source is the route of the Files
	 *										feature, which the kernel streams with its ranges, so that the player can seek - and
	 *										shows the comments on it in the order of their time in the track, with the answers
	 *										under them and a form to write one: at the second the player is at, or at a time typed
	 *										as m:ss, or at none.
	 *
	 *										A comment is POST /.review/comment, a plain form post (the script helps with the time
	 *										and with answering and posts nothing): a refusal or the success is answered with a
	 *										redirect to the page the form was on, ?review=<id>&review-state=<state>. The owner
	 *										reads, answers, marks as done and deletes in the panel (Review\Admin). The data is
	 *										Review\Store's, /data/review.php.
	 *
	 *										Other features build on it through comments(), add(), media() and seconds(), and the
	 *										callback '/review/comment', which is fired with the entry of every comment a member
	 *										posts through the route and the owner answers with in the panel.
