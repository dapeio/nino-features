	 *	Nino							A compact filesystembased php framework
	 *	Colours						The palette half of a design: every surface a look bands
	 *										with, and everything readable on each of them, solved
	 *										from two colours and five knobs rather than written by
	 *										hand.
	 *
	 *										A set decides which surface a component sits on ("this
	 *										section is alt"); this decides what that surface and its
	 *										ink actually are, and guarantees the pair meets a
	 *										contrast target. Solved in OKLCH, whose L is perceptual,
	 *										so a hue can be moved onto a target ratio without
	 *										changing what colour it reads as - sRGB and HSL
	 *										lightness cannot do that, since yellow at 50% is far
	 *										lighter than blue at 50%. Every emitted pair is then
	 *										measured with the real WCAG formula rather than assumed
	 *										from a lightness, so the promise is one the tests check
	 *										rather than a convention they trust.
	 *
	 *										Lifted from the kernel's own Design module, which shipped
	 *										this until the look left the core in 1.2. The maths is
	 *										that code unchanged - it was measured against the
	 *										framework's own colours and there is no reason to
	 *										re-derive it - and what changed is the half that is gone:
	 *										the size raster, which the library's part sets and their
	 *										knobs now own (see Setup::KNOBS).
	 *
	 *										What it writes is what library/base.css already declares,
	 *										surface for surface. base.css is the framework's palette
	 *										as a static default, so a project that never opens the
	 *										Colours tab keeps exactly the look it had, and one that
	 *										does gets the same tokens with solved values - one block
	 *										further down the same cascade.

		/*	A Theme addresses these, never a ramp step. default/alt/dark/black
			already exist as .nino-section--* and as Areas' frame choices, and
			tint is the fifth ground: the page ground carrying the brand hue
			rather than a near-grey.

			Then the brand, as four roles rather than two. Every one of them is
			one colour answering one of two questions - is it the brand or the
			second colour, and is it the one that was picked or the one text
			survives on:

				brand         the primary exactly as picked, never written on
				brand-safe    that same colour, lightness solved until it is
				accent        the second colour exactly as picked or derived
				accent-safe   that same colour, made safe the same way

			Two used to do this work, and the pair broke the moment a Secondary
			colour was set: the safe surface became the *accent* made safe, so a
			theme's buttons quietly stopped being the brand and there was no
			contrast-safe brand colour left anywhere in the palette. Four roles
			is what it takes for "brand" and "second colour" to both exist and
			both be usable.

			The three status surfaces are the same idea applied to meaning
			rather than brand - an alert is a surface with text on it like any
			other, so it comes out of the same machinery and carries the same
			promise.	*/

			adoptable - turning it on must not move a project that has not
			asked for anything - and it is why the tables below are anchored on
			2 rather than on their midpoint by accident.

			Three rather than five because the in-between positions were not
			decisions anybody made. A setting that reads "less, as it is, more"
			is one an operator can hold in their head; asking them to choose
			between "Restrained" and "Even" is asking them to have an opinion
			they do not have. Where a knob replaces one that shipped with three
			named values, the three positions are those exact values - so a
			theme drawn against the old vocabulary looks identical under the new.

			Numbers rather than names because these are positions on a scale,
			not a vocabulary: "airy" invites the question what lies past it,
			where 3 of 3 does not. The name each position carries is a label
			for the operator, published in KNOBS, never a stored value.

			Not every decision is a scale, though, and the ones that are not
			say so. A knob is a 'scale' - three positions, 2 is the framework -
			or a 'choice': a named list of alternatives with no more and no less
			about it, and its own default. Harmony and Temperature are choices.
			Which hue the greys lean on is not "less" or "more" of anything, and
			the four classical harmonies are not a track you slide along; both
			were pretending to be scales, and the pane was telling the operator
			the middle position is always Nino's own while two knobs' were not.
